Assignment Part A:

a)  Introduction:
    The website I have to chosen to improve is the Namibian governments Office of the Prime Minister's website
    https://opm.gov.na/ .More specifically, I have chosen to re-work the home page. The target audience for the 
    website is Namibian citizens who want to know more about the Office of the Prime Minister, e.g what they do 
    ,upcoming projects or simply keep track of public service announcements or statements. This includes all age groups,
    eg students upto retired citizens. Members of the public can also use this site to keep track of the progress of the 
    various undertakings of the OPM via reports available for download.  

    In order for the site to be accessible to the target audience, it has to be simple to navigate and simple to 
    find the desired content. This includes easy access to the necessary links to download reports or other documents,
    aswell as an easy way to navigate sections that display announcements or other statements.

    The visual design is inadequate when compared to more modern designs. The layout of the page is 
    somewhat confusing with some components repeated in different sections. The color scheme is not 
    appealing. Furthermore, some elements are not centered when they should be and others are innappropriately 
    sized compared to their neighbours. 

b)  The website is responsive to changing screen sizes. The fonts scale accordingly when switching from a desktop view 
    to a mobile view. The same can be said for images. Additionally, the navigation bar collapses into a dropdown menu 
    when a certain screensize is reached. The site content is also rearranged depending on screensize. In terms of loading time,
    the site loads quickly, even on slower connections. Furthermore, images and other linked content load almost instantly 
    with most content loaded once the user is ready to start browsing the site.

    While the layout does change according to screen size, the mobile view rearranges the content in a confusing way 
    when compared to the desktop version. 

c)  The site content is relevant to what is expected but is presented in a somewhat unclear way. The latest statements are layed out 
    in an easily accessible manner but only with the desktop layout. In the mobile layout, the statemnets are mixed with what would 
    have been sidebar content in the desktop layout.  

    With the desktop layout, the all functional requirements were met. However, with the mobile layout, certain tables are cut short 
    and make it extremely difficult to view all the information or download the shared documents due to conflicting font and background
    colours.

d)  Navigation is easy due to the provided navigation bar and links provided within the content. It is easy to see where everything can be 
    found without having follow various links to eventually get to the content you want. Labels are clear and accurately describe the content 
    that will be found under that section. Navigation is like following a well made map through an unknown city.
    
    Global navigation is provided by the navigate bar that is always present at the top of the page. The is little to no local navigation aside 
    from scrolling down. Most pages are well defined and display only relevant content that requires no through different sections.
